      <h3>in a nutshell</h3>
      <p>
        I earned a degree in Civil Engineering from MIT.  After turning my brass rat around on graduation day, I jumped into the working world.  As an operations consultant, I worked among a ton of smart and powerful people who are experts in their fields.  I learned how to assess the state of a company's operations, identify its greatest opporunities for improvement, and guide clients to implement solutions that ultimately drive efficiency.  The things that I learned as a consultant prepared me well for my next role as the manager of the analytics and systems-automation functions within an education non-profit.  With increasing exposure to the systems that support operational functions within organizations, I came to realize that I was drawn to those systems and wanted to be able to build them for myself.  Now, I have the privilege of pursuing the next chapter of my career - one that combines all of the things that I enjoy: finding <b>creative</b> solutions to <b>ambiguous</b> problems; creating <b>efficiency</b> and building structure out of <b>chaos</b>; and producing <b>helpful</b> tools.
